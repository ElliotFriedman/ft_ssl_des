		||
		\/

	Determine mode. ECB or CBC

		||
		\/

	Pass in 8 bytes at a time

		||
		\/

	Turn key into 2 halves

		||
		\/

	Make 32 subkeys which are 48 bits long, derived from halved key

		||
		\/	
	
	32 Subkeys are derived from bitwise rotate operations

		||
		\/

	From subkeys derive 15 new subkeys labeled Kn, from k2 to k16, 48 bits in length

		||
		\/

	Now we start to encode

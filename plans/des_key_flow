				Generate key based on hash of pass
							
							||
							\/

				Key is permuted from 64 to 56 bits

							||
							\/

				Enter encryption function w/Stack Variable of key & 64 bit block of text/ciphertext

							||
							\/
			
				While Loop:
						
							split key into 2 28 bit halves

							Then rotate each subkey X times

							Then add them back together to get a 56 bit key

							Then use Compression Permutation on 56 bit key to make a 48 bit key

							Pass Compressed key to XOR with output of Expansion permutation

							repeat loop 16X

				How to Decrypt:
					
							Use same loop

							Precompute all 16 keys

							Use subkeys in reverse order

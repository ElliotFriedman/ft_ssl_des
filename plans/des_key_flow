				While Loop:
						
							split key into 2 28 bit halves

							Then rotate each subkey X times

							Then compress them according to Compression Permutation

							Pass Compressed key to XOR with output of Expansion permutation

							Mash two split keys back together to form 56 bit key

							repeat loop 16X
